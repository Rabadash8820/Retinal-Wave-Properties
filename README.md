# MEA Cruncher

This application is intended to replace the hodge podge of Excel macros that have accumulated during my data analysis work with Dr. Jordan Renna in the University of Akron Biology Department.
Rather than writing documentation to help he and his lab navigate all of those spreadsheets, dictating the file names and directory structures that they should use, and requring them to manually open third party softwares like
Offline Sorter and NeuroExplorer as part of the process, I figured I would just write an application to make everything simple and user-friendly.

Moreover, this project represents a sort of culmination in my understing of Visual C#, WinForms, Git source control, scrum programming, the .NET framework, NHiberate, and MySQL.  My hope is that this project will provide proof of my experience
with these methods and technologies to future software development companies, even though my degrees will be more biologically oriented.
